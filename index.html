    <h2>xoL: Visual programming language - Concept design</h2>
  </div>

  <div id="description">

  <p>xoL is an experimental concept design for a visual programming language.</p>
  <p>xoL is an attemp at creating a visual interface for programming. Based on the belief that programming can go beyond text editors. More sophisticated graphical visualizations, can make easier to understand programs. More specialized user interfaces can make easier to work with them.
xoL is a graphical programming language, designed to be more efficient to use than text based ones. An elegant, yet powerful general purpose graphic language, with a sophisticate UI, well suited for tablets and desktops.</p>
  <p>xoL is statically typed, object based, hybrid functional, planned to be implemented on top of javascript. Its design is oriented toward simplicity and symmetry.</p>

	<p>In the link below, there is an earlier xoL version available for viewing. The final version of xoL has various changes.</p>

    <p><span class="question">What is xoL?</span><br/>
    A visual programming language designed to be more efficient than traditional text based programming.</p>

    <p><span class="question">What problem does solve?</span><br/>
    Increases developers productivity and happiness, by making programming easier.</p>

    <p><span class="question">Who needs it?</span></br>
    - Developers that want better tools to program.</br>
    - Folks that wants better tools to learn to program.</br>
    - Platform owners that want the best tools on their platforms.
    </p>

    <p><span class="question">What is the current status of the project?</span></br>
    Design is largely complete. UI design is in progress. Prototype construction has been started.</p>

  <p>Visual is used to refer to programming languages that employ graphics, instead of just text
   to convey information. xoL uses a graphical representation of programs that emphasizes programming concepts.
   xoL UI would replace most of the text plumbering in programming, with GUI operations.</p>

   <p>Visual languages have failed to gain mainstream acceptance. Currently
   all programming, save some minor niches, is done with text based languages.</p>

  <p>Not considering platform attachment, visual languages so far have failed against text based
    ones, on the fundamental features that make languages usable. These features are a few key points,
    that drive programmers preference of languages. When language selection is not forced by the platform
    or ecosystem, selection is driven mainly by these factors:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Language design: technical features that conform the language.</li>
  <li>User Interface (UI) efficiency: Amount of effort required to perform actions.</li>
  <li>Information density: Amount of information shown per screen surface.</li>
  <li>clarity: information must be clear and easy to read.</li>
  <li>Tooling: capability to extend or automate tasks with custom tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>xoL intends to demonstrate that with careful design, a graphical programming can surpass text based languages on most, if not all of these fundamentals. Positioning itself as the preferable choice for development. It should be capable of attaining growth, initially mainly between programmers not attached to specific platforms or ecosystems. Then becoming of interest for hardware platform holders, who want to have the best tools for their platforms.</p>
